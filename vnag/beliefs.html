        <p>
            As a member of the <b>Assemblies of God,</b> our church subscribes to
            the 16 Fundamental Truths of the Assemblies of God. This list is
            derived from the official Statement of Fundamental Truths.

                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...The Scriptures are
                    Inspired by God and declare His design and plan for mankind. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...There is only One True
                    God&#8211;revealed in three persons...Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (commonly
                    known as the Trinity). <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...In the Deity of the
                    Lord Jesus Christ. As God's son Jesus was both human and divine. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...though originally good,
                    Man Willingly Fell to Sin&#8211;ushering evil and death, both physical and
                    spiritual, into the world. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...Every Person Can Have
                    Restored Fellowship with God Through 'Salvation' (trusting Christ,
                    through faith and repentance, to be our personal Savior). [1 of 4

                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...and practice two
                    ordinances&#8212;(1) Water Baptism by Immersion after repenting of one's sins
                    and receiving Christ's gift of salvation, and (2) Holy Communion (the
                    Lord's Supper) as a symbolic remembrance of Christ's suffering and
                    death for our salvation. <br />

                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...the Baptism in the Holy
                    Spirit is a Special Experience Following Salvation that empowers
                    believers for witnessing and effective service, just as it did in New
                    Testament times. [1 of 4 cardinal doctrines of the AG] <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>... The Initial Physical
                    Evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is &#8216;Speaking in Tongues,&#8217; as
                    experienced on the Day of Pentecost and referenced throughout Acts and
                    the Epistles. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...Sanctification
                    Initially Occurs at Salvation and is not only a declaration that a
                    believer is holy, but also a progressive lifelong process of separating
                    from evil as believers continually draw closer to God and become more
                    Christlike. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...The Church has a
                    Mission to seek and save all who are lost in sin. We believe 'the
                    Church' is the Body of Christ and consists of the people who,
                    throughout time, have accepted God's offer of redemption (regardless of
                    religious denomination) through the sacrificial death of His son Jesus
                    Christ. <br />
                    <strong>WE BELIEVE</strong>...A Divinely Called and
                    Scripturally Ordained Leadership Ministry Serves the Church. The Bible
                    teaches that each of us under leadership must commit ourselves to reach
                    others for Christ, to worship Him with other believers, to build up or
                    edify the body of believers&#8211;the Church and to Meet human need with
                    ministries of love and compassion. <br />

                    Hope&#8212;When Jesus Raptures His Church Prior to His Return to Earth (the
                    second coming). At this future moment in time all believers who have
                    died will rise from their graves and will meet the Lord in the air, and
                    Christians who are alive will be caught up with them, to be with the

                    begins His benevolent rule over earth for 1,000 years. This millennial
                    reign will bring the salvation of national Israel and the establishment

                    Take Place for those who have rejected Christ. They will be judged for
                    their sin and consigned to eternal punishment in a punishing lake of

                    people, of all time, who have accepted Him. We will live and dwell with
                    Him there forever following His millennial reign on Earth. 'And so
